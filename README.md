This is a Devops resume challenge where i am trying deploy a 3-tier application to minkube cluster. Here I have a frontend app (Reactjs), a backend application (NodeJS) and a database (Postgres).

The goal is to develop a deep understanding of DevOps processes and tools by tackling challenging, real-world problems.

I hope i get things right and be a master of the DevOps practices
